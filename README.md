# e2d3R

The goal of e2d3R is to eventually provide full-featured [`e2d3`](https://e2d3.org) htmlwidgets.  Currently, this is only a small step in the right direction and consists of a dependency function and some experiments.  I would love for someone, anyone to jump in and push this project forward in any way.

## Installation

You can install e2d3R from github with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("timelyportfolio/e2d3R")
```

## Example

As I mentioned above, I really only have experiments now.  Please see https://github.com/timelyportfolio/e2d3R/.
